h2. What

Typed accessors creates a set of accessors with a predefined typed.
Often when dealing with webservices all the data comes back as
strings, but you really want to be working with these things as
numbers or dates.  Manually converting them is duplication, and can be
error prone.

h2. Installing

<pre syntax="ruby">sudo gem install typed_accessors</pre>

  >> f.float = "1"
  => "1"
  >> f.float
